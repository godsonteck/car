# User Deletion Fix - Task Progress

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated `deleteUser` method in `user_service.dart`
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Changes Made**:
  - Changed method signature from `void deleteUser(String userId)` to `Future<void> deleteUser(String userId)`
  - Added proper Firebase Firestore deletion using `await _firestore.collection('users').doc(userId).delete()`
  - Added Firebase Auth deletion attempt (only works if user is deleting themselves)
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Added proper async/await pattern

### 2. Updated admin screen to handle async deleteUser method
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `_showDeleteConfirmationDialog` method to use `await userService.deleteUser(user.id)`
  - Added proper async/await pattern in the delete button onPressed handler
  - Maintained existing error handling and success feedback

## ðŸ“‹ Task Summary

**Problem**: Admin deleting a user didn't actually delete from Firebase - only removed from local list.

**Solution**: 
- âœ… Properly delete user document from Firestore
- âœ… Attempt to delete from Firebase Auth (with limitations for admin deleting other users)
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully
- âœ… Update UI to use async pattern
- âœ… Maintain proper logging and user feedback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Firebase Auth Deletion Limitations
- Firebase Auth deletion requires admin privileges or the user to be signed in as that user
- For admin deleting another user, this will fail without Firebase Admin SDK
- The user remains in Firebase Auth but is properly deleted from Firestore and local app state

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for both Firestore and Auth operations
- Graceful degradation - continues with local deletion even if Auth deletion fails
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages in the UI

## âœ… Testing Status

**Minimal Testing Done**: 
- Code compilation successful
- No runtime errors detected
- Async pattern properly implemented

**Remaining Testing Areas**:
- Test user deletion in actual Firebase environment
- Verify Firestore document deletion
- Test error scenarios (network issues, permission problems)
- Verify UI feedback and error messages

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** in a development environment
2. **Verify Firebase console** shows proper deletions
3. **Test edge cases** like network failures, permission issues
4. **Consider Firebase Admin SDK** for full Auth deletion capabilities if needed

---

**Task Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - User deletion now properly removes users from Firebase Firestore and attempts Auth deletion where possible.
