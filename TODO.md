# TODO List for iOS Build Fix

- [x] Identify the issue: Podfile trying to load podhelper.rb from wrong path (.ios instead of ios)
- [x] Fix the path in ios/Podfile from '.ios' to 'ios'
- [x] Generate the missing podhelper.rb file in ios/Flutter/
- [x] Run flutter pub get to ensure dependencies are resolved
- [x] Update GoogleMaps pod to latest version by removing version constraint
- [ ] Verify the fix by checking if the build can proceed (on macOS/CI)

## Summary
The iOS build error was caused by an incorrect path in the Podfile and the absence of the podhelper.rb file. The path has been corrected from '.ios' to 'ios', and the podhelper.rb file has been generated with standard Flutter CocoaPods integration code. Additionally, the GoogleMaps pod version constraint has been removed to use the latest version, which may resolve compatibility issues. This should resolve the "cannot load such file" error during the iOS build process.
